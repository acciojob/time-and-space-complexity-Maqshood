	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficientcy of an algorithm by quantifying the amount of time it takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps developers analyze and compare algorithms to determine which one performs better, especially for large datasets. Common notations like O(1), O(log n), O(n), and O(nÂ²) describe how an algorithm's runtime scales, ensuring optimal performance in real-world applications. Understanding time complexity is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size, denoted using Big-O notation such as O(1), O(log n), or O(n). It measures how efficient an algorithm is in terms of memory usage, helping developers optimize resource consumption. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity uses memory proportional to the input size, while O(1) indicates constant memory usage. Analyzing space complexity ensures that programs run smoothly without excessive memory overhead, making it essential for designing scalable and efficient systems.</p>
